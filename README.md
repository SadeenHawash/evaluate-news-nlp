# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

This project is a simple web application built using Express, Node.js, and Cheerio for web scraping, along with a client-side JavaScript app to interact with the server. The app allows users to enter an article URL, scrape the text content, and analyze it for sentiment using AWS NLP services.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend server for handling requests.
- **Express**: Web framework for routing and static file serving.
- **Cheerio**: Library for scraping and parsing HTML content.
- **AWS NLP API**: Used for sentiment analysis of scraped text.
- **Service Worker**: For caching and offline support on the client side.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SadeenHawash/evaluate-news-nlp.git
   cd evaluate-news-nlp
   ```

2. Install dependencies for the server:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the front-end (client) code:

   ```bash
   npm run build

   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will start the backend server on http://localhost:8000.

## Usage
